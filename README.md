## Task

- Add Redux based logic into prepared Calculator template
- Make operations work as they should

## Notes

styles.css was given, I made minor changes to accommodate disabled state of components but I didn't "restyle" entire css so hover and other states remain inconsistent.

Also I didn't implement entire calculator logic as I didn't see necessary to have all the functions like division, percentage or chained operations. Calculator only takes a number, an operation, a second number and calculates the result. Simple but imho enough for expressing React and Redux skills.

Task was created in https://codesandbox.io/ and then uploaded to Github. That is why there is no git history.
